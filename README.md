# Browns US Replacement


[Browns US Replacement - Arma Reforger Workshop](https://reforger.armaplatform.com/workshop/624A8B96AA67EFEB-ATMAfricanFIAReplacement)

Spelled out, it's an ArmA Reforger mod that replaces the US faction's characters.

The intent of this project is to provide a lightweight and reliable BLUEFOR solution in a Southern African region environment.

The features I wanted to have right from the start are :
- [x] No dependencies, thus using only Vanilla items.
- [x] Simplicity for the end-user, thus the Replacement way (overrides).
- [x] SADF distinctive ‘brown’ nutria camouflage.
- [x] ‘houding’ variants, hallmark of an ‘ouman’.
- [x] Rooi Staaldak.

Known issues
- [ ] The camouflage appear too dark ingame. Despite using recommended RGB values, themselves an interpretation of Humbrol colors.
- [ ] The thumbnails are not matching the actual character. 


Future
- [ ] Camouflaged armament.
- [ ] Camouflaged vehicles.
- [ ] Moar variantz.

What else ?

Thanks to Chaz for the inspiration.
